Our platform redirects 100% of ad revenue to charity initiatives that serve African communities. By choosing AdsForAfrica, you're not just advertising; you're making a tangible impact on education, healthcare, and sustainable development in underserved regions.

Join AdsForAfrica today and help create positive change, all while promoting your brand. Together, we can make a difference.</p>
      <h2>Volunteer</h2>
      <p>Ads for Africa is supported ENTIRELY by community support, through donations, volunteering, and the graciousness of the servers that are hosting us (hence why every once and a while we go down for 30 minutes to switch hosts, as to not overstay our welcome). Currently, the founder of AFA is the primary torch bearer, however, that could one day be you! Join AdsForAfrica as a volunteer here, or alternatively, donate here (please note that these donations go 100% to us, however once we reach our hosting requirements, the surplus will go into the pot for charity, but this is primarily to support the HOSTING of the AdsForAfrica project)!</p>
      <h2>End User</h2>
      <p>Ads are annoying, right. What if I told you there was a platform that delivers ads that HELP. Ads that do good, not for you, but for somebody. Ads that save lives. It seems much easier a burden to bear, no? We'll at least that's what we at AdsForAfrica think! Here at AFA we prioritize turning something purely capatalist, purely selfish, into something that can benefit. I don't say that in a communist way, I love capatalism, but I think there's surely a balance between what is currently happening in the Advertisement (especially online) industry and the rest of the world's needs. Here at AFA we hope this disconnect can be bridged partially by using AFA.</p>
